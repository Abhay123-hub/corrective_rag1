The Rajya Sabha, also known as the Council of the States, is the other house. Currently, Narendra Damodardas Modi holds the position of Prime Minister of India./nCurrently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds the position as the 14th Prime Minister of India. He has served two consecutive terms and becomes the fourth Indian Prime Minister to achieve this feat and the first non-Congress Prime Minister to do so. Note: The Prime Minister of India is the leader of the government in the Republic of India/nNarendra Modi is the current prime minister of India for the 3rd consecutive term since 2014. In this article, we have provided the List of Prime Ministers of India From 1947 to 2024. ... Still, they need the backing of most of the Lok Sabha members, elected directly every five years, to hold onto the position. The prime minister may be present/nRajiv Gandhi, an Indian statesman, held the position of the sixth Prime Minister of India from 1984 to 1989. P. Singh, was an Indian statesman who served as the seventh Prime Minister of India from 1989 to 1990. Chandra Shekhar, an Indian politician, held office as the eighth Prime Minister of India from November 10, 1990, to June 21, 1991. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a revered Indian politician and statesman, held the position of the 10th Prime Minister of India for three distinct periods. Who is the current Prime Minister of India?/nAlso, as the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the PM also exercises control over the Indian Administrative Service (IAS),[93] the country's premier civil service,[94][95] which staffs most of the senior civil service positions;[94][95] the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB);[96][97] and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),[96][97] except for the selection of its director, who is chosen by a committee of: (a) the prime minister, as chairperson; (b) the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha; and (c) the chief justice.[98]\\nUnlike most other countries, the prime minister does not have much influence over the selection of judges, that is done by a collegium of judges consisting of the Chief Justice of India, four senior most judges of the Supreme Court of India and the chief justice—or the senior-most judge—of the concerned state high court.[99][100] But during his reign, the 2002 Gujarat communal riots in the state of Gujarat took place; resulting in about 2,000 deaths.[55] Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister came to an end in May 2004, making him the first non-Congress PM to complete a full five-year tenure.[53]\\nIn the 2004 election, the Congress emerged as the largest party in a hung parliament; Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA)—with outside support from the Left Front, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) among others—proved a majority in the Lok Sabha,[56] and Manmohan Singh was elected prime minister; becoming the first Sikh prime minister of the nation.[56] During his tenure, the country retained the economic momentum gained during Prime Minister Vajpayee's tenure.[57] Apart from this, the government succeeded in getting the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, and the Right to Information Act, 2005 passed in the parliament.[58][59] Further, the government strengthened India's relations with nations like Afghanistan;[60][61] Russia;[62] The prime minister of India (IAST: Bhārat kē Pradhānamantrī) is the head of government of the Republic of India.[2][3] Executive authority is vested in the prime minister and his chosen Council of Ministers,[4][5][6] despite the president of India being the nominal head of the executive.[7][8][9][10]\\nThe prime minister is often the leader of the party or the coalition with a majority in the lower house of the Parliament of India, the Lok Sabha,[11] which is the main legislative body in the Republic of India.[12] In the subsequent general election, the Congress secured an absolute majority, winning 401 of 552 seats in the Lok Sabha, the maximum number received by any party in the history of India.[31][32] Vishwanath Pratap Singh—first finance minister and then later defence minister in Gandhi's cabinet—uncovered irregularities, in what became known as the Bofors scandal, during his stint at the Ministry of Defence; Singh was subsequently expelled from Congress and formed the Janata Dal and—with the help of several anti-Congress parties—also formed the National Front, a coalition of many political parties.[33]\\nIn the general election of 1989, the National Front—with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front—came to power.[34] V. P. Singh was elected prime minister.[34] Languages of the Prime Minister's Office\\nThe official website of the Prime Minister's Office is available in 11 Indian languages namely Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu, out of the 22 official languages of the Indian Republic, in addition to English and Hindi.[105]\\nThe eleven Indian language websites can be accessed at the following links:\\nCompensation and benefits\\nArticle 75 of the Constitution of India confers the Parliament with the power to decide the remuneration and other benefits of the prime minister and other ministers are to be decided by the Parliament.[106] and is renewed from time to time.\")],\n",
